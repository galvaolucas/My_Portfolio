# Getting Started with Create React App

In this project, that was created with React JS, using HTML, CSS and Javascript, you will see my personal portfolio.

There's still work to do, it is a demo version, not completed yet.

When all the work has been completed, i will uptade the final version.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To see what I've made (if you already have the npm installed :) )

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
